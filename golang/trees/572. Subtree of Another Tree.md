# 572. Subtree of Another Tree

## thoughts

### dfs

- detect whether tree rooted at node is same as tree rooted at subRoot by [100. Same Tree](https://github.com/SeanZhenggg/leetcode-practice/blob/master/golang/trees/100.%20Same%20Tree.go)
- check root first, and recursively check left subtree and right subtree
- if root is empty at each recursive call, that means tree is empty, then it couldn't be same as subRoot, so we can simply return false for that circumstance
