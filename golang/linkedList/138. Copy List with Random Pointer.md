# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

## thoughts

### iteration + hashmap

- loop through every node in the linked list, and use a hashmap to record every new node corresponding to the original node; in the meanwhile, link all new nodes to form a new copied linked list
- loop through again to link the random pointer of new node by using hashmap to find the corresponding new random node with the old 

### recursion + hashmap

- recursion function accept current node as input, and return new node as output
- recursive find the new node of current new node's random as well as its next node
- use a hashmap to record node which has been visited before; if input is found in hashmap, simply return the corresponded copied node

### interweaving

- interweave old and new nodes, make new list like this: 
  - [old 1st node] -> [new 1st node] -> [old 2nd node] -> [new 2nd node] -> ...
- then we can find the new random node by calling current.Random.Next 
- first, loop through old list, and link every random pointer of new nodes to their new random node
- second, loop through again, remove the link between old and new, link all old nodes back together, and link all new nodes to form a new copied list
