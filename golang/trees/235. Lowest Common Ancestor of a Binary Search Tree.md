# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

## thoughts

### solution 1

- get reverse ancestors list of two nodes p, q (including p, q itself)
- loop against the longer ancestors list among p, q
- use another var j to represent the current index of shorter
- continuously check whether ancestor of the longer equals ancestor of the shorter, if equal then return ancestor of the longer
- continuously check if i >= length of the longer - length of the shorter, if so, then increment j by 1

### solution 2 - dfs

- dfs + post-order traversal
- return two values: one represent as LCA node, the other represent that node is found in the current subtree
- if current root is empty, return (nil, false), means we didn't find the LCA node and node of p or q is not in the subtree
- check if there is p or q in left/right subtrees, denoted as lFound/rFound
- after traverse left/right subtrees, check if current node is one of p and q, denote as midFound
- if one of three conditions is met, then return current root as LCA node
  1. midFound and lFound
  2. midFound and rFound
  3. lFound and rFound
- else return (nil, midFound || lFound || rFound)  
 
### solution 3 - binary search tree

- utilize the characteristic of binary search tree, the key of each node:
  - is greater than all the keys in the respective left subtrees
  - is lesser than all the keys in the respective right subtrees
- as describe above, there is three conditions could occur: 
  - if root.Val > p.Val and root.Val > q.Val, means that p and q must exist in left subtree, so continue traversing the left subtree 
  - if root.Val < p.Val and root.Val < q.Val, means that p and q must exist in right subtree, so continue traversing the right subtree
  - otherwise, p and q could be in different subtrees, then current root would be the LCA node
    - another scenario is that current root equals one of p or q, that means the current root is LCA
