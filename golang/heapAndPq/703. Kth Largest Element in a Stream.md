# 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream

## thoughts

### heap sort + binary search

- first use heap sort to sort initial input array
- at each Add(val) call, use binary search to search the correct position to insert the value
- after binary search process done, return array element at index ```len(array)-len(k)```

### min heap

- use min heap to store number of k largest elements
- initialize heap with input array, and call heap delete method to delete elements if current heap size is beyond k
- each times calling Add(), call heap add to append new value into heap, and call heap delete method if current heap size is beyond k
- return heap element at index 0, that is the smallest element in heap. because of using min heap as data structure, the smallest element in heap happens to be the kth largest element so far.
