# 226. Invert Binary Tree

## thoughts

### dfs

- use dfs approach recursively traverse every node in the tree.
- at each node, swap it's left subtree and right subtree.
- use another variable to store one of them before swapping, to avoid memory address overlapping during the swapping. 

### bfs

- use bfs approach (level order traversal) iteratively traverse every node in the tree.
- at each node, swap it's left subtree and right subtree first.
- if left subtree of current node is not empty, append left node into queue.
- if right subtree of current node is not empty, append right node into queue.
