# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

## thoughts

### dfs

- calculate height of current node using the approach in [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://github.com/SeanZhenggg/leetcode-practice/blob/master/golang/trees/104.%20Maximum%20Depth%20of%20Binary%20Tree.md) 
- at each traversal, check whether tree rooted at current node is balanced by checking it's left and right subtrees' height differ in less than 1 and it's left and right subtrees are also balanced
```go
hOfLeft, isLeftBalanced := dfs(root.Left)
hOfRight, isRightBalanced := dfs(root.Right)

math.Abs(float64(hOfLeft-hOfRight)) <= 1 && isLeftBalanced && isRightBalanced
```
