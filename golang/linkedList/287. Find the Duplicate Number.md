# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

## thoughts

### sorting

- sort input nums in ascending/descending order
- loop through sorted array, and find the index satisfied the condition nums[i] == nums[i-1]
- return nums[i]

### hashmap/hashset solution

- loop through entire nums array
- use a hashmap/hashset data structure to store each number visited before
- if current number was stored in hashmap before, then it would be the duplicate one

### mark negative

- loop through entire nums array
- flip the number we've seen before by setting ```nums[cur]``` to negative
- if ```nums[cur]``` is already negative, the duplicate is found, which is ```cur```

### array as hashmap(recursion)

- start at index 0, recursively do the following:
- if ```nums[index] == index```, means the duplicate is index, return ```index```
- else mark nums[index] = index

### array as hashmap(iteration)

(TODO)

### binary search
