# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

## thoughts

1. serialize
   - expect to follow the tree string representation used by leetcode(although not necessary)
   - using BFS + queue DS to append all nodes' values into slice of string
   - if meet empty nodes in left/right subtrees, append nil into queue as well.
   - for all nodes at current level, if node is nil then append "null" string and skip the rest operations, otherwise append root.Val and go down
   - Because of the empty nodes at leaf nodes' subtrees, <font color="yellow">get tree height first and compare it with current level to avoid appending empty nodes at leaf node level</font>.
     ```go
     func getTreeHeight(root *TreeNode) int {
       if root == nil {
         return 0
       }
       return 1 + max(this.getTreeHeight(root.Left), this.getTreeHeight(root.Right))
     }
     
     // ...
     
     // comparison between tree height and current level
     top := queue[0]
	    queue = queue[1:]
	    if top == nil {
	      if lvl < treeHeight {
           ret = append(ret, "null")
	      }
        continue
	    }
     ```

2. deserialize
    - trasform input string into slice of string(used *int here)
    - using BFS + queue to traverse every nodes
    - stop when queue length is empty or slice is empty
    - get each node popped from queue, create node for it
    - skipping nil nodes
    - append left first, and check if slice still has values, if so, then append right as well
