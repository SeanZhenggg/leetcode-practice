# 973. K Closest Points to Origin

## thoughts

# min heap

- store all points into min heap, comparison based on the distance difference between point and 0,0
- loop to poll the kth smallest values and return
- TC will be O(n * logn)

# max heap

- store only number of k values into max heap
- if heap size is greater than k while we are inserting value, poll the maximum value out
- that means, we store only number of k smallest values into max heap
- loop to poll the kth smallest values and return
- TC will then turn into O(n * logk)
