# 139. Word Break

## thoughts

### top-down dp
- if s[:i] is in wordDict, wonder if s[i:] can be segmented into space-separated sequence of one or more words in dict.
- problem f(i) becomes sub-problems:
  - supposed have 3 different length of words: 1,2,3
  - if word of length 1 matched, problem becomes if s[i+1:] can be segmented into space-separated sequence of one or more words in dict.
  - if word of length 2 matched, problem becomes if s[i+2:] can be segmented into space-separated sequence of one or more words in dict.
  - if word of length 3 matched, problem becomes if s[i+3:] can be segmented into space-separated sequence of one or more words in dict.
- value function:
  - `f(n) = true if s[n:] can be segmented into space-separated sequence of one or more words in dict` 
- recurrence relation:
  - `f(i) = true if one of the s[i:i+w] is in wordDict and f(i+len(w)) is also true, where w is the word in dict`
  - `f(i) = false if neither is true`
- base case:
  - `f(len(s)) = true, because no other sequence left, means s has matched condition`

### bottom-up dp
- value function:
    - `dp[n] = true if s[n:] can be segmented into space-separated sequence of one or more words in dict`
- recurrence relation:
    - `dp[i] = true if one of the s[i:i+w] is in wordDict and f(i+len(w)) is also true, where w is the word in dict`
    - `dp[i] = false if neither is true`
- base case:
    - `dp[len(s)] = true, because no other sequence left, means s has matched condition`
- return dp[0]
- can also do in the reverse way, base case is 0, return dp[n]

### BFS
(TODO)
