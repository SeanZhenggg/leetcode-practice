# 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree

## thoughts

- dfs/bfs (iterative/recursive)
- use `count` to keeps track of the number of good nodes
- use another state value `maxValFromRoot` to track to maximum value on the path from the root to the current node
- increment `count` if node value is ≥ `maxValFromRoot`
- NOTE : traversal order doesn’t matter
