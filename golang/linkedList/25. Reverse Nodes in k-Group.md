# 25. Reverse Nodes in k-Group

## thoughts

### recursive solution

- loop through to count every k node by counter ```i```
- after counting k nodes:
- if ```i == k```, recursively do the next counting
- else means there is less than k nodes left, no need to do reversal, simply return the head
- when recursion backtracks, do the reverse for k nodes at current recursion stack
- the node returned from recursion would be the head of reversed linked list
- make sure to link previous reversed linked list tail to the next reversed linked list head 

### iterative solution

#### 1.

- same as recursion solution concept
- use following variables:
  - head : current k linked list head
  - revHead : the head of reversed linked list
  - kTail : the tail of reversed linked list
  - newHead : the new overall reversed linked list head, which is the first kth node

#### 2. 

- loop through entire linked list
- use a counter i to record how many nodes has passed through
- if ```i == k```, do the ```reverse```
- else simply move forward the head to the next node
- ```reverse```: 
  - accept two nodes, ```begin``` and ```end``` : ```begin``` represents the prev node of the head of every k group linked list, ```end``` represents the next node of the tail of every k group linked list
  - use ```first``` to record the head of original k linked list
  - use ```prev``` to record the prev node when doing reverse
  - use ```cur``` to record current node position while doing reversal, initially set to ```first```
  - loop and reverse every node's connection until ```cur == end``` 
  - tricks: make ```prev``` assigned by end at the beginning, then at first loop of reversal, first will link to end, which is what we want after reversal done
  - after reversal, make ```begin``` link to the ```prev``` node, which is the new head of reversed linked list
  - return ```first``` node, which is the tail of reversed k linked list
