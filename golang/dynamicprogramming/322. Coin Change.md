# 322. Coin Change

## thoughts

### recursion

- brute force
- `total` represented as total amount of coins chosen, `count` represented as number of coins chosen
- for each step, loop through every coin, and recursively call dfs to next step with new parameters if choose some coins could satisfy the `condition total + coins[i] <= amount`
- if total == amount, means we've found one path, determine whether it is the minimum count

### dp solution (top-down)

- `total` represented as rest amount after we choose some coins
- value function: `dp[total] = number of coins chosen`
- value transfer formula: `dp[total] = min(dp[total], 1 + dp[total-coins[i]])`
- (**the adding 1 means we choose current coin, that is count 1**)
- base case: total = `0`, `dp[0] = 0`
- **for each step, refresh count to max value**
- for each step, loop through every coin, and recursively call dfs to next step with new parameters if choose some coins could satisfy the `condition total + coins[i] <= amount`
- if `total == 0`, means we've reach the base case `dp[0] = 0`, return `0`
- else return `max value` denoted that we didn't find the path, after returning to previous step and passing into value transfer formula, the count won't change
- use `dp` array to memorize the path we've been before, and initially set all elements to default value(max value)

### dp solution (bottom-up)

- same as previous but using iterative approach
- value function: `dp[total] = number of coins chosen`
- value transfer formula: `dp[total] = min(dp[total], 1 + dp[total-coins[i]])(**the adding 1 means we choose current coin, that is count 1**)`
- (**the adding 1 means we choose current coin, that is count 1**)
- base case: total = `0`, `dp[0] = 0`
