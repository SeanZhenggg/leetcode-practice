# 21. Merge Two Sorted Lists

## thoughts

- use a dummy head to store the head of merged linked list
- compare list1 val with the other val
- append smaller node to dummy head at every iteration
- if one of the list points to empty node, stop the for loop
- if there are nodes left in another list, append it's head to the current head
- return dummy head next pointer
