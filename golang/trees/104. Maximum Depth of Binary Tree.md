# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## thoughts

### dfs

- use post-order traversal
- if traverse to empty node, return depth of zero
- after traversed left and right subtrees, return depth of one plus the maximum depth between two of them
- depth of one represent the current node

### bfs

- use level-order traversal
- use a lvl variable to record current level we traversed so far
- if left subtree is not empty, append left node into queue
- if right subtree is not empty, append right node into queue
- return lvl as answer
