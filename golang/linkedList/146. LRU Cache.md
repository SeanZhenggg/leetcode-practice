# 146. LRU Cache

## thoughts

- use hashmap + doubly linked list to achieve O(1) time complexity for both get() and put() ops
- hashmap store key and its corresponding linked list node as value
- head next node represented as most recently used node
- tail prev node represented as least recently used node
- when doing get() op: 
  - check if key exists in the hashmap
  - if not, simply return -1
  - otherwise, get its node in the hashmap and move it from the tail to the head
- when doing put() op:
  - check if key exists in the hashmap
  - if true, simply update its node's value, and move it from the tail to the head
  - otherwise, create a new node, add it into hashmap, and insert it after head
  - if hashmap length is greater than capacity, means we need to remove the LRU node in the hashmap and linked list
  - remove the node ```this.tail.prev```, and remove it from the hashmap
