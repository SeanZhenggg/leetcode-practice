# 2. Add Two Numbers

## thoughts

- go through every node in two lists to perform addition at each digit
- use a variable to record the extra carry after addition
- keep doing previous operations until both list head points to empty
- if carry is still gt 0, create a new node to hold the carry value as highest digit
- return head
