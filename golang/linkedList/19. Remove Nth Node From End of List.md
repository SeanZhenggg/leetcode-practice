# 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List

## thoughts

- use slow/fast pointers method
- first, let fast walk through n nodes
- then let fast and slow walk through (len - n) nodes, till fast node reach the end
- slow will then stop at nth node from the end 
- use a prev pointer to record the previous node of slow
- if slow == head, means that head would be the one to removed, then simply return head.Next
- else make prev next pointer point to the next node of slow, and return head
