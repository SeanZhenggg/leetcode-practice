# 143. Reorder List

## thoughts

# hashmap

- use hashmap to record each node
- use two pointers start from leftmost and rightmost end, merge two half nodes

# reverse half and merge

- use slow/fast pointers to find the middle of given linked list
- reverse the second half linked list
- merge two half lists into single reordered list

# recursion

- two parameters: 1. root represent as root node, 2. current represent as current node
- return one value: next left head node
- go through top-down to the rightmost node by passing every current.Next as current parameter
- if current is empty, return root
- if returned head is empty, return nil
- if returned head is same as current or head.Next is current, means we reached the middle left/right node, then simply set current.Next = empty and return nil
- else set head.Next to current and current.Next to head.Next(temp), and return head.Next as next head node
