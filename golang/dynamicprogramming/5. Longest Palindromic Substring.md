# 5. Longest Palindromic Substring

## thoughts

### two pointers solution: start from each character as the center

- for each character, check every substring that can be extended from it to get the maximum length of palindromic substring
- use two pointers algo to check whether a substring is a palindromic substring
- in the beginning with each character, we need to shift the pointers outwards as far as possible if the adjacent characters are same, to avoid misjudgement for even length palindromic substrings    
- alternatively, we can process palindromic substrings with odd and even length separately 

### brute force two pointers solution: check all substrings

- check every possible substring if it is a palindromic substring, and take the longest one
- start from the longest-length substrings and iterate toward the shorter-length substrings
- once a palindromic substring is found, stop the iteration, because it is guaranteed to be the longest
    ```go
    for length := len(s); length > 0; length-- {
        for left := 0; left < len(s)-length+1; left++ {
            // right = left + length
            // check if it is a palindromic substring
        }
    }
    ```

### dp solution

- overlapping subproblems: if s[i+1:j-1] is a palindromic substring, then if s[i] == s[j], s[i:j] is also a palindromic substring
- memorization: record f(i,j) = true for each (i,j) in len(s), if we found s[i:j] is a palindromic substring
- optimal substructure: to get the maximum length of palindromic substring, the inner substring in it must be palindromic substring as well 
- value function: f(i, j) = true if s[i:j] is a palindromic substring, false otherwise
- recurrence relation: f(i, j) = s[i] == s[j] && f(i+1, j-1)
- base case :
    - f(i,i) = true for every i in len(s)
    - **<span style="color:yellow">f(i, j) = true if s[i] == s[j] && j - i < 3</span>** \
      e.g. s = "bab", i = 0, j = 2, s[0] == s[2] && j - i = 2 < 3 \
      <span style="color:red"> because j - i < 3 means there would be at least 1(or no) character in the middle of substring, and left and right characters are the same, so it is palindromic substring as well
