# 100. Same Tree

## thoughts

### dfs

- dfs post-order traversal
- check if current p is empty or current q is empty, if so, then p, q are same only if both are empty
- recursively check whether left/right subtrees are same, and return ```p.Val == q.Val && isSame(p.Left, q.Left) && isSame(p.Right, q.Right)``` 

### bfs

- bfs level-order traversal
- at each level, check if current p is same as current q 
- if they are not the same, return false
- append all pairs of ```{p.Left, q.Left}```, ```{p.Right, q.Right}``` into queue
- stop after all nodes in queue were compared(```len(queue)== 0```), then return true
