# 91. Decode Ways

## thoughts

### top-down recursive solution w/ memorization

- start from the end of string, denote as position n
- if nth char(<span style="color: #ffff00;">which is s[n:n+1] if n starts with len(s)-1</span>) is valid, problem becomes sub-problems of len(n) - 1
- if chars from n-1 to n(<span style="color: #ffff00;">which is s[n-1:n+1] if n starts with len(s)-1</span>) are valid, problem becomes sub-problems of len(n) - 2
- keep going through sub-problems, until met the condition n < 0, return 1 as one valid way to decode
- add returning value from both two path only if they can form a valid way 
- using hashmap or array to store results of each sub-problems

### bottom-up recursive solution w/ memorization

- same thoughts as previous solution
- but start from the beginning of string, denote as position 0

### iterative dp solution

- value function:
  - f(n) = number of ways to decode substring s[0:n]
- base case: 
  - f(0) = 1 <span style="color:#ffff00">(think of it as if substring of the first two chars is valid, then f(0) represented as one way to decode, that is s[0:2])</span>
  - f(1) = 1 if s[0] is valid, else f(1) = 0
- value transfer formula: 
  - for single digit decoding path, f(n) = 0 + f(n-1) if s[n-1] is valid
  - for two digits decoding path, f(n) = f(n) + f(n-2) if s[n-2:n] is valid

### iterative dp solution w/ constant space

- same as previous solution, but from previous solution we know we only need to record previous two results in order to generate current result
- use three variables newP, p0 & p1 to store f(n), f(n-1) & f(n-2)
- at each iteration ends, update p0 = p1(p1 becomes the second to last in next iteration), p1 = newP(newP, that is f(n), becomes the last in next iteration)
- after iteration finished, return p1 as the result
