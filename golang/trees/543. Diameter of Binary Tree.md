# 543. Diameter of Binary Tree

## thoughts

### dfs 

- diameter of a tree is the maximum length between nodes in the tree, that means the diameter of tree must be the
maximum of sum of left height and right height of the nodes in the tree. 
- use a variable to record the maximum diameter, at traversal of each node, compare and update it with the sum of l/r height of it.
- return the height of current node, that would be the maximum height of left/right + 1(including current node)

### bfs
