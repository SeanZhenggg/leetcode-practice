# 152. Maximum Product Subarray

**failed**

## thoughts

### brute-force solution

- check every possible substring and calculate its product, take the maximum one
- time complexity: O(n^3) -> TLE
- can reduce time complexity from O(n^3) to O(n^2):
    ```
    var result int 
    for i := 0; i < len(nums); i++ {
        prod := 1
        for j := i; j < len(nums); j++ {
            prod *= nums[j]
            res = max(res, prod) 
        }
    }
    ```

### dp solution

- also known as **kadane's algorithm**
- value function:
  - `maxF(i)`: the **maximum product** of subarray [x, i], where i is on the right side and x is somewhere on the left side
  - `minF(i)`: the **minimum product** of subarray [x, i], where i is on the right side and x is somewhere on the left side
- three conditions to get maximum product(so as minimum product) at index i:
  1. index i itself form a subarray
  2. index i is positive, `nums[i] * maxF(i-1)`
  3. index i is negative, `nums[i] * minF(i-1)` (neg * neg = pos)
- recurrence relation:
  - `maxF(i) = max(nums[i], nums[i] * maxF(i-1), nums[i] * minF(i-1))`
  - `minF(i) = min(nums[i], nums[i] * maxF(i-1), nums[i] * minF(i-1))`
- the maximum value in maxF subarray is the result
- additional: could use two variables to record maxF/minF to optimize space complexity

### prefix/suffix solution

- came from [neetcode.io](https://neetcode.io/solutions/maximum-product-subarray)
- at each index i:
  - **if current prefix/suffix is 0, update to 1 (IMPORTANT!!!)**
  - calculate the prefix product and suffix product(`len(nums)-1-i`), and take the maximum one
  - after all, return the maximum value recorded
- how this work:
  - normal cases:
    - nums = [**-1**, 2, 3, 4], the maximum product subarray is the suffix at index 1(which results 24)
    - nums = [2, 3, **-2**, 4], the maximum product subarray will be the prefix at index 2(which results 6)
    - nums = [**-2**, 3, 6, **-4**], both prefix at the end and suffix at the beginning get maximum product subarray(which results 144)
    - **if there are odd numbers of negatives in array, the maximum product subarray will always be subarray containing only even numbers of negatives(and all elements are relatively greater)**
    - **if there are even numbers of negatives in array, the maximum product subarray will always be the entire array**
  - special cases:
    - nums = [-3, **0**, 1, -2]:
      - the maximum product from prefix is 0(after index 1 the value will be 0 to the end)
      - the maximum product from suffix is 0 too(after index 1 the value will be 0 to the end)
      - but the maximum product is 1, that is the subarray [2,2]
      - so if prefix product at index i result in 0(that is, multiply by 0), we need to reset it to 1, which will let the possible maximum product start at next index, so do suffix
