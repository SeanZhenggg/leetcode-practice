# 102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal

## thoughts

### bfs

- bfs + level-order traversal
- go through each level of the tree, append all nodes in that level into output
- output is an 2-d array, so index is tree level
- use a var ```level``` to represent which level we are traversing, default is ```0```
- at each node traversal, compare if ```len(outputs) == level```, if so, that means we are going to traverse on this level, hence append a new list into ```levels[level]```
