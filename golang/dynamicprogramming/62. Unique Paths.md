# 62. Unique Paths

## thoughts

### dynamic programming

- only two direction to move: right and down
- to reach at right bottom corner, only two ways to choose: 
  1. the left of the right bottom corner and move one step right.
  2. the top of the right bottom corner and move one step down.
- the problem becomes two sub-problems
- value function:
  - f(m, n) = number of unique paths to reach to right bottom corner
- recurrence relation:
  - `f(m, n) = f(m-1, n) + f(m, n-1)` where m represent row index and n represent column index 
- base case:
  1. set f(0, 0) ~ f(0, n), f(0, 0) ~ f(m, 0) to 1, which means for start point, there's only `one` way to reach the bottom or the rightmost
  2. all m, n of f(m, n) starts from index 1, leave f(0, 0) ~ f(0, n), f(0, 0) ~ f(m, 0) to 0. **make one of (0, 1), (1, 0) to 1**, cuz this op will make the 1st row/col the same as previous case
